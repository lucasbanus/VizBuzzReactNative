      <description><![CDATA[<p>TV host Ant Anstead and 2009 Formula One champion Jenson Button are about to live every car enthusiast's dream: design their own car. They -along with automotive designer Mark Stubbs and attorney Roger Behle- are revitalizing Radford, a British coach-builder famous for its customization work in the 1940s and 1950s.

      <itunes:summary>Bozi Tatarevic is a race car mechanic, automotive writer, and all around knowledge buffet. He&apos;s sort of like an automotive detective meets crew chief.

He&apos;s full of interesting facts and stories, and definitely worth a follow.</itunes:summary>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Our good friend Chef Carl Ruiz of The Food Network, La Cubana NYC Restaurant, the Opie Radio Podcast and countless other ventures, suddenly passed away over the weekend. While we are all reeling from his death, I want to take the opportunity to celebrate Carl's amazing appearance on our other show, Watch & Listen. This episode focuses on Carl's general philosophy on watches, which I later titled, "Carl Ruins Everything." And it's the best primer on watches for someone who loves, or who hates watches. </p><p>This episode is available as a video - get it at: https://youtu.be/VZcrVQtHbXE</p><p>Also check out his other two appearances<br />TST Podcast #441: Opie Hughes & Carl Ruiz<br />https://youtu.be/7ZFZrIU5wPI</p><p>Watch & Listen Podcast #35: History of Rolex With Carl Ruiz<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFtN6cMzS-U</p><p>We will miss Carl very dearly, talk about him often, and remember the lessons of his life. <br />RIP Chef Carl Ruiz 1975-2019 #ruizingforver</p>

      <title>Alan Macey - (Manual Gearbbox Preservation Society)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Alan Macey thinks about cars differently than we do. After graduating from Art Center of Pasadena (arguably the best school for automotive design in the world), he interned at VW, and then worked as a designer at Jeep. He sees cars differently than us. We see a panel gap, and he knows why it's that size. He understands the constraints designers have when they design a new car. He also created the Manual Gearbox Preservation Society ( links below).   We talk about design, Bugatti, VW, challenges of selling a new car, and then we get into a DEEP conversation about AI, the future of car ownership, and argue about how soon it will all arrive.   It's a good listen. </p><p>New Shirts: <a href="https://www">https://www</a>.blipshift/com/tst</p><p>Follow us!</p><p>T: @thesmokingtire @zackklapman @amacey3000</p><p>IG: @thesmokingtire @fakezackklapman </p><p>https://www.facebook.com/TheManualGearboxPreservationSociey/<br />https://thecurbshop.com/collections/all-products</p><p> </p><p>WATCH this show: https://youtu.be/S9ocH3gZ3Yw</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In studio this week Pete Callaway of <a href="http://www.callawaycars.com/">Callaway Cars</a> joins us. Most people know Callaway for their very potent Corvette packages however they provide solutions for many of GM V8 platforms and Pete shares their origins in modifying BMW 3 series' and first gen VW GTIs. It's not often that we have two VERY fast press cars on hand simultaneously and it's a rare day that one of them is a GT-R and it feels slow by comparison.  Matt and Zack fill us in on the insanity that is the Callaway AeroWagen.</p>

After filming nearly half the content on /DRIVE and The Smoking Tire, he left to seek fame and sun burns. He's returned with tales of lawless driving, speed limits go ignored, the deletion of blinkers, turbo-charged off-roaders, and his 6-month stretch decidind what used car to buy. Should he buy a C63 AMG? Or a used Ford Raptor? What about a rally car? Maybe finance a McLaren (hint: no)? Or should he buy a BMW M3? The circle goes round and round. </p>

He&apos;s returned with tales of lawless driving, speed limits go ignored, the deletion of blinkers, turbo-charged off-roaders, and his 6-month stretch decidind what used car to buy.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week we bring you an onslaught of automotive industry asshattery, with too many damned people in the room.  We're joined by Mike Spinelli, Travis Okulski, Brendan McAleer and Austin Cabot. Mike gives us his take on on the Porsche GT3 RS as well as an overview of the soundtrack to Dante's Peak, Stevee Nicks encounters and a young boy's take on Burt Monroe.  Travis gives us some insight into the Ferrari F12 TDF as well as his take on unnecessarily ostentatious german press tours. Whilst Brendan and Austin take a far more measured approach jabbing with the occassional one-liner or groan inducing pun as we power our way through two power outages mid show.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>We've got an old friend in the studio this week one Craig Lieberman (<a href="https://twitter.com/craiglieberman">@CraigLieberman</a>). Craig is one of the unsung heroes of the Fast and Furious franchise, he tells the story of how he went from car geek to consultant on what is now one of the largest film franchises ever. Paul Walker's Supra in the fast and furious was quite literally Craig's car that was leased to the studio for the film and his Skyline was one of the hero cars from Fast and Furious 2.  </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week we're joined by John Bothwell Commercial Director of <a href="http://www.pursangweb.com/">Pur Sang Automotive of Argentina</a>. Pur Sang builds what are referred to as "continuation cars" which basically amount to exact recreations of classic cars built entirely by hand. Some might dismiss Pur Sangs Bugattis as kit cars but you'd be hard pressed to tell the difference between an original factory Bugatti and a Pur Sang continuation built in exactly the same manner as the original. We spend a lot of time talking classic Bugattis, middle-eastern extravagance, manufacturing and the quirks of doing business in Argentina.</p>

With Travis' impending time in the Z06 we of course discuss that and the potential of its new 8 speed automatic. But we also touch on Top Gear, launching an M4 via a 5" curb, many bad Bob Dylan jokes, an update on Matt's Lexus LS400 and <a href="https://vine.co/xpacNino">Nino's new status as a Vine celebrity</a>.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Recorded just prior to Christmas Matt is back from a cross country drive with his girlfriend the proud owner of a Lexus LS400 nearing 900,000 miles. Zack in the mean-time has taken up quad-copter camera duty while Thad has resorted to filling his Fiesta with race gas to make obscene power and I didn't do a damned thing other than work and make cookies. This week we had a <strong>Mustang Ecoboost</strong> in and we discuss that along with our usual mix of barely socially responsible nonsense.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week <a href="http://motoman.tv">George "Motoman"</a> Notaras joins us for the cavalcade of general insensitivity wrapped in the guise of automotive journalism we call our podcast. We spent some quality time with Dinan BMW 1 Series M along with the new 2014 Subaru WRX.  We compare said WRX to Thad's modified Fiesta ST and follow it up with a little talk about the street racing scene in Compton.  While in Compton Zack and Thad were likely filmed by the new drone overlords of the LA Count Sheriff's Department.  All that and a little insight into the fraternity life of those that partook.</p><p> </p>
